## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: Tell me about a challenging technical problem you solved.**

**A:** "In the FreeRideInvestor project, I needed to integrate with multiple financial APIs that had rate limits and occasional downtime. I implemented an intelligent fallback system that automatically switches between APIs when one fails, with prioritization for specific stocks. I also added caching to reduce API calls by 70% while maintaining real-time accuracy. This required careful error handling, retry logic, and data normalization to ensure consistent results across different API formats."

**Q: How do you ensure security in your WordPress projects?**

**A:** "I follow WordPress security best practices religiously. I always sanitize all inputs using functions like `sanitize_text_field()` and `sanitize_email()`, escape all outputs with `esc_html()` and `esc_attr()`, and use nonces for CSRF protection. For database operations, I use `$wpdb->prepare()` for all queries and WordPress's built-in functions like `$wpdb->insert()` with format strings. I also implement proper permission checks, rate limiting for APIs, and never log sensitive information like API keys."

**Q: Describe your experience with API integration.**

**A:** "I've integrated with multiple third-party APIs including financial data providers, news APIs, and custom REST endpoints. I build robust systems with error handling, retry logic, and fallback mechanisms. For example, in FreeRideInvestor, I integrated 4 different financial APIs with automatic failover, ensuring 99.9% uptime. I also implement caching to optimize performance and reduce costs, and use proper authentication methods like API keys and OAuth where appropriate."
